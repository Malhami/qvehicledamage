The cost of repair is estimated to be between **\u20ac1,700 and \u20ac3,000**, depending on the severity of underlying damage and need for door replacement. Fraud likelihood is assessed as **low**, based on the realistic nature of the damage and the image provided.", "vehicle_type": "Vehicle Analysis: Toyota Yaris (based on the visible design and badge)", "damage_types": ["Dent", "Scratch", "Collision"], "fraud_likelihood": "Low", "cost_estimate": "\u20ac400", "severity": "Severe", "report_id": "20250501110204063124"}
